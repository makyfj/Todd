# Todd

Graphql Server that allows users to vote for Todd's best ideas. I just finished watching Bojack Horserman
and I'd love to see what is Todd best idea :) plus I can practice my graphql skills

## Technology:

    Nexus: Code first approach
    Prisma: Best tool to deal with Sql dbs
    NextJS: Best react framework :)
    Tailwindcss: Easy and fast development
    Apollo-server
    Apollo-client
    Typescript: Gotta love type safety :)
